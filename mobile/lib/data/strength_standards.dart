/// each other. It means nothing to someone who has never heard of
/// Wilks/DOTS — a bare "your DOTS is 287" doesn't tell an untrained lifter

/// The thresholds below are a flat bodyweight-multiplier table (PR ÷
/// bodyweight), the same convention most public strength-standards
/// calculators use. They're a deliberately simple approximation, not a
/// scientific or federation-sanctioned figure — real relative strength
/// doesn't scale perfectly linearly with bodyweight (that non-linearity is
/// exactly why DOTS uses a polynomial instead). Good enough to say
/// "roughly intermediate," not precise enough to argue over a single kg.
