; Inno Setup script for Kilo (Windows; formerly Ironpeak Fitness).
;
; Before this file existed, windows.yml only produced a plain .zip of the
; Release folder — "download the update, tap install" then just opened
; that zip in Explorer, it never actually replaced the running app. This
; compiles into a real setup.exe: a normal install wizard, a Start Menu
; shortcut, a proper uninstaller registered in "Apps & Features", and —
; via CloseApplications/RestartApplications below — it closes a currently
; running Kilo before installing and relaunches it afterwards,
; which is what actually makes UpdateProvider's "download -> install ->
; it's the new version" flow true on Windows.
;
; #MyAppVersion is passed in from windows.yml at compile time
; (`iscc /DMyAppVersion=1.2.3 installer.iss`) so the installer's version
; always matches the tag the release was built from, same as the app
; binary itself (see Runner.rc's VERSION_AS_STRING). The /D default below
; only matters for a local/manual `iscc` run with nothing passed in.

; Fixed and must never change between releases -- this is what lets Inno
; Setup recognize "this is an upgrade of an existing install" (same
; install dir, replaces in place, keeps it in Apps & Features as one
; entry) instead of installing a confusing second copy side by side.
; The doubled leading "{{" is required, not a typo -- Inno Setup treats a
; single "{" in a [Setup] value as the start of a {constant} reference
; (like {app}), so a literal brace (as GUIDs need here) must be escaped by
; doubling it, per ISCC's own "Unknown constant" error message.
